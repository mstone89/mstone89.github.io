Offered a great technique to get the modal to appear correctly on page. First created an overlay element that is initially hidden, the purpose of which is to show a transparent color behind the opened modal. Also helped with understanding z-index.

This page helped me understand how to save, get, and remove data to local storage, which is an integral part of the app since one of the features I wanted was to be able to save gifs in favorites.

This line of code helped me understand how to read the position of the scroll in the viewing window. Using this, I figured out how to integrate it into my code and do another API request to load in more results once the user reaches a certain scroll point.

These pages helped me understand what the hash anchor is, and how to know if a page is loaded with a hash anchor in the URL. This allowed me to include functionality to allow users to share a unique URL with an anchor in it, and load the page using the ids embedded in the anchor.
